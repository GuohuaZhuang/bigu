1. Create VHost in apache.

	Change the following 2 root path and set your servername. (and set DNS in hosts file with ServerName)
	
		<VirtualHost *:80>
		   DocumentRoot "/var/git/bigu/public"
		   ServerName bigu.com
		   SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV production
		
		   <Directory "/var/git/bigu/public">
		       Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
		       AllowOverride All 
		       Order allow,deny
		       Allow from all 
		   </Directory>
		
		</VirtualHost>
	
	For Ubuntu Apache2:
		Then you should save this configure file as name which you set your servername, 
		for example, you can set save it as "bigu.com".
		And now you can do "sudo a2ensite bigu.com" to add this vhost site.
		Last you just must do "sudo service apache2 reload".
	
	For Windows Apache2:
		You can add in httpd.conf or apache2.conf, or some extra conf.and then restart apache2.

2. Create data and tmp file and set it all operator permissions if neccessary.

	For Linux:
		cd bigu
		mkdir data && sudo chmod 777 data -R
		mkdir tmp && sudo chmod 777 tmp -R
		mkdir public/upload/flash/ && sudo chmod 777 public/upload/flash/ -R
		mkdir public/upload/img/ && sudo chmod 777 public/upload/img/ -R
		mkdir public/upload/thumb/ && sudo chmod 777 public/upload/thumb/ -R
		mkdir public/util/jquery_php_avatar/thumb/ && sudo chmod 777 public/util/jquery_php_avatar/thumb/ -R
		mkdir public/util/jquery_php_avatar/upload/ && sudo chmod 777 public/util/jquery_php_avatar/upload/ -R
	
	For windows:
		use explorer to create folder with name data, tmp, public/upload/flash/, public/upload/img/, public/upload/thumb/, 
		public/util/jquery_php_avatar/thumb/, public/util/jquery_php_avatar/upload/, and set it's permission property as 
		everyone can write them.


INSTALL NOTES:

	1. You should install apache2(with php5, has gd, mysql and pdo with mysql support) and mysql.
	2. You can change mysql connection info like username, password and port in application/configs/application.ini if neccessary.
	3. You must be sure your project bigu dir is not in no permission access parent dir, just like /root and other no 755 permissions.
	4. You must add rewrite.load in apache2 to supprt .htaccess rule. (for ubuntu you can command "sudo a2enmod rewrite")
	5. If you want to access both by ip and alias server name, you cat set "ServerName 127.0.0.1" temporary.

For more sucurity, we suggest you to modify some configurations:
	1. Ture off the php expose information.
		edit /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini.
		    expose_php=Off
	2. Remove Apache version and also operation system information.
		edit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf or /etc/apache2/conf.d/security, you are be sure just set them just once.
			ServerSignature Off
			ServerTokens Prod
	3. Also we have change the session name in Boostrap.php, so if you are not like change a customize name, do not change it.
		ini_set('session.name', 'BIGUSID');
	4. Ture off allow url open and url include.
		allow_url_fopen=Off
		allow_url_include=Off

Also, you should change your own informations in those files:
	./application/configs/application.ini  [modify mysql connection info]
	./application/modules/auth/controllers/IndexController.php [change your admin email SMTP/POP3 user and password]
	./public/html/foot.html [modify your icp number name]
