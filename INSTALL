1. Create VHost in apache.

	Change the following 2 root path and set your servername.
	
		<VirtualHost *:80>
		   DocumentRoot "/var/git/bigu/public"
		   ServerName bigu.com
		   SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV production
		
		   <Directory "/var/git/bigu/public">
		       Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
		       AllowOverride All 
		       Order allow,deny
		       Allow from all 
		   </Directory>
		
		</VirtualHost>
	
	For Ubuntu Apache2:
		Then you should save this configure file as name which you set your servername, 
		for example, you can set save it as "bigu.com".
		And now you can do "sudo a2ensite bigu.com" to add this vhost site.
		Last you just must do "sudo service apache2 reload".
	
	For Windows Apache2:
		You can add in httpd.conf or apache2.conf, or some extra conf.and then restart apache2.

2. Create data and tmp file and set it all operator permissions.

	For Linux:
		cd bigu
		mkdir data tmp && sudo chmod 777 data tmp -R
	
	For windows:
		use explorer to create folder with name data and tmp, and set it's permission property as everyone can write them.
